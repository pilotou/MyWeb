#### This is my final project for the Berkey Web Design DeCal .

I studied this course for almost a week. And I found this course is very friendly for beginner to learn how to do web design.

In general, this course is a great course. It has two parts, one is programming, teach you the "three sword" of front-end: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The other is design, it teach you the concept of design, including color, typography and so on.

The thing that I love most is their homework and lab. They provided a detailed instruction for homework and lab so I can apply want I learn from the lecture. That's also the part that I appreciate most.

Time flows. Now it's my last task for this course, design a web page. I hope I can code a beautiful web page in response of what I learn. And it may take a lot of time for I am not a artist and lack of the understanding of aesthetic. But I'll try.

That's it.
